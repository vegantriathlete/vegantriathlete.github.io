I see what this repo is meant to do -- My very own page on github.com!

Hooray! I cloned the repo onto my local machine. I created an index.html, committed it and pushed it.

Don't count on anything useful appearing here, ever. This is a sandbox for
my own learning about what I can do on github.

Feel free to post your thoughts in the wiki or file an issue, though ;-)

I am testing whether my github settings (specifically my key pair) is still working properly. Let's see if I can commit and push this change. BTW, I needed to sudo vi this file since it was owned by root ;-( Why do I have it set up that way? I don't know and I don't feel like chown'ing or chgrp'ing it right now.

I don't have any idea what I'm doing.

Maybe some day this will contain something useful.

Edit: Now I see what this repo is meant to do -- My very own page on github.com!
I guess I've got to clone it into my local repo and start adding an index.html.
It seems that since this README already exists, I can edit inline. But, I don't see a way to add another file
directly through the github interface.

Hooray! I cloned the repo onto my local machine. I created an index.html, committed it and pushed it.

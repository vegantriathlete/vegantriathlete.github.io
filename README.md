I see what this repo is meant to do -- My very website on github.com!

Hooray! I cloned the repo onto my local machine. I created an index.html, committed it and pushed it.

More information on building user pages at pages.github.com

Don't count on anything useful appearing here, ever. This is a sandbox for
my own learning about what I can do on github.

Feel free to post your thoughts in the wiki or file an issue, though ;-)
